    Hello everyone my name is Kshitij Prakash i hail from lucknow uttar pradesh i did
    my schooling from LPS.My hoobies include playing football,chess, video games and my other
    areas of intrest are to play guitar in my free time,im enthusiastic about a career in naval aviation
    hence i aspire to join indian nava academy after my bachelors
    to be a warbird aviator.A very vital quality one need to be succesfull
    in life is strong will power, people with good will power or determination are tougher and more successfull
    than those who lack this quality.It is a vital quality required for most of our difficult endeavours.
    The quality is far more important than talent, will power can be improved just the way we can build our physical muscles.
    Will power is the ability of a persons mind, it is however dependent upon the health of the body. A hungry and tired
    man will display, weaker will power
    with a person with matching inherent, qualities who has had a good sleep and wellfed, In our efforts to improve our will power, we need
    the support of healthy eating, sleeping and exercising habits.one of the many ways to improve ones will power is through meditaion
    It is a direct way to control our thoughts and prevent them from wandering in an undesired and unproductive manner. Even 10 minutes per
    day will help to improve will power.I would like to conclude my part by saying that this quality can be developed by patience and perseverance
    by taking small steps towards our the guide goals, effort in this direction will pay great dividends in the future.</p>
